    "  - Hint 1: You can do this with a combination of `groupby` and\n",
    "    `join`.  \n",
    "  - Hint 2: `customer_type` is always either `Returning` or\n",
    "    `First-time`.  \n",
    "  - Hint 3: Some customers don’t have a\n",
    "    `customer_type == \"First-time\"` entry. For these customers, you need to set their\n",
    "    values to some date that precedes the\n",
    "    sample’s dates. After adding valid data back into `orders` DataFrame,\n",
    "    you can identify the customers who don’t have a `\"First-Time\"`\n",
    "    entry by checking the new column for missing data.  \n",
    "1. You need to group by three things.  \n",
    "1. You can apply one of the built-in aggregation functions to the GroupBy.  \n",
    "1. After the aggregation, you need to use your reshaping skills to\n",
